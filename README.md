In this research, I have proposed a variation to the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game called the Iterated Round
Robin tournament of the  (IRRT) Prisoner's Dilemma game. As a variation of the Prisoner's Dilemma Game, this model 
studies the evolution of cooperation as an adaptive behaviour in an iterated tournament of the PD game when there is the introduction of an uncertain acquisition of a number of opponents' past actions upon request by a player at a cost.
This variation of the PD model stems from practical applications in the business, political science as well as sports eld where having partial information about the historical past actions of your opponents play vital roles in decision making.
